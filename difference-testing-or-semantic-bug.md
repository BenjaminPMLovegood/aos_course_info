## difference-testing
- Coverage-directed differential testing of JVM implementations
- Privacy oracle: a system for finding application leaks with black box differential testing
- Guided differential testing of certificate validation in SSL/TLS implementations
- Randomized Differential Testing as a Prelude to Formal Verification

   主要是一个 case study，给飞行软件做随机测试
    也是和 ref impl 对拍，但是加上 NAND 模拟和错误注入、反例最小化
